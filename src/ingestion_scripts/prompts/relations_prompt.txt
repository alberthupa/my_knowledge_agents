Analyze WINDOW {window_num}/{total_windows} from '{file_name}' to extract:
1. ATTRIBUTES: Key properties/characteristics of each entity
2. RELATIONS: How entities are connected to each other

Entities found in document: {entity_list}

PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED RELATIONS:
{existing_relations_text}

For each entity, identify important attributes like definitions, categories, properties, etc.
For relations, specify which entities are connected and how (e.g., "Entity A is part of Entity B", "Entity C depends on Entity D").
ONLY describe relations and attributes that are evident in THIS window.

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS JSON:
{{
  "entities": {{
    "Entity1": {{
      "attributes": {{"attribute1": "value1", "attribute2": "value2"}}
    }},
    "Entity2": {{
      "attributes": {{"attribute1": "value1", "attribute2": "value2"}}
    }}
  }},
  "relations": [
    {{"source": "Entity1", "relation": "relates to", "target": "Entity2"}},
    {{"source": "Entity2", "relation": "depends on", "target": "Entity3"}}
  ]
}}
